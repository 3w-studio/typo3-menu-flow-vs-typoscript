# typo3-menu-flow-vs-typoscript
First built complex menu in Typo3 7.6.7 in Flow, but then I noticed a bug with language fallback. 
Maybe it helps somebody to find the right code.

Type-7.html is used to override the Menu Type 7 which you can create as a content element. It requires the VHS-Extension to be installed in the Extension Manager.

The Typoscript version is included via Typoscript.
